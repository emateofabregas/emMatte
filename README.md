## Features: 
* Depending on the **'Matte type'** that you choose, there are different shape options. For example, in Matte Type 'Shape', you can choose the classic Sphere or Cube. Or in the projection, you have the same and Flare or Custom ones.
 
* The **'Ramp (Beta)'** is a 3D Ramp following the XZ Axis.

* **'Pproject' and 'Pproject + cam'** are quite similar, the only difference is the camera thing. The option with a camera is useful if you want to recycle your camera from a specific frame, for example.

* In the flare option, you can control the corners, the edge flattening, the corner sharpness, and the angle too.

* The **'3D Noise'** option is just a 3D Noise that you can make in your scene following Noise (Perlin Noise), Turbulence, or fBm. With this same noise, you can mix it with the rest of the Matte Types with the same knobs.

* The tool adds a **'random'** knob so that you can make another effect with the noise. If you are interested in searching for something specific in this result.   

* You have extra control with 3d knobs (Translate, Rotation, Scale, Uniform Scale, and Skew) in your mask.

* 'Falloff Type' and **'Falloff'** are different algorithms to make different effects in the alpha transition.
  
* You can also add a specific 'Mask' in your **'Mask Input'** if you need it.
